- A 1-2 summary or bullet points outlining your plan for check-ins throughout the duration of the project.

  - Daily Stand-Up

  - Slack Huddles

- A 2-4 sentence summary of your plan for project organization and workflow. This can include bullet points. If you plan to use a project management tool, please include a link to your project board.

  - Plan to use [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/calforcal/projects/3/views/1) and [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/TjIF5fu9bgMhhlUOascdLV/High-Level-Overview?node-id=0-1&t=1E7xOjwEiG3oqIeH-0)
    - Understand where we currently stand, an outline of to-dos and project timeline.
    - Figma for a design sketch of how we plan to build out our code.

- A 2-3 sentence summary describing the different approaches your group discussed for project organization and how you collectively made a decision on which to use.

  - Ultimately we decided on GitHub projects because it is where our Repository is hosted which helps with linking to-dos to certain areas of the code, and 2 project members had prior experience using it. Also Figma seemed like a good resource for visually planning our code design, we can all collaborate on the same page at once.

- A 2-3 sentence summary describing your approach to the code design.
  
  - Started off with a rough estimate of what classes we might need, and how we might break that down amongst the group. Also defining when something is "good enough", leaving a chance for the other member of the group to review and suggest edits, keeping everyone involved. Then we took to a design board to help visualize the different parts of our code

- Include link to your initial DTR document and the date it was completed. If you do additional DTRs later in the project, you should link the revised versions here as well with the date. New versions should be listed alongside older versions. Do not delete old DTRs.
